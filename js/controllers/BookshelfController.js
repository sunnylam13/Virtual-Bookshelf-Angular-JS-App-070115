/* 
* In the controller BookshelfController, use the books service to load data from the server into the $scope.myBooks.
* 
* Finish the template views/bookshelf.html so that it displays each book.
* 
* NOTE: in views/bookshelf.html, we're using <a href="#/books/{{ $index }}"> to create a URL for each book. 
	* The $index gives the index of a book in the myBooks array. 
	* This means the URL of the first book is #/books/0, the URL of the second book is #/books/1, and so forth.
*
* NOTE:  it's interesting to note that the base layer here doesn't require '$routeParams' in the function at all...
	* the other controllers do...
